Instead of writing about something productive, I am going to again write about writing.  Or at least the infrastructure for writing.  First, I decided to switch comments from Disqus to [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/), which is a clever approach to hosting comments for statically-generated sites.  For each post, the script creates a GitHub issue and adds each comment to the issue.  There are no ads, and it is all around more civilized.  Moreover, I appreciate the simplicity of the model.  Not that I expect an excessive comment load.

Next, I updated the version of the [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) static site generator from something very old to the latest as of the time of writing.  I am very pleased to report that it did not require any code changes.  I can only aspire to that level of stability in my own code.  Despite not requiring any code changes, I took the opportunity to change one line of code to enable support for writing in Emacs org-mode instead of markdown.
