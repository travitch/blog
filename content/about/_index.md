My name is Tristan Ravitch.  I am broadly interested in high-assurance systems, program analysis, and verification.  I am currently an applied scientist in AWS Privacy Engineering.

Previously, I was a Principal Researcher at [Galois](https://galois.com/) where I worked on legacy systems understanding, assurance, and resilience. That work involved static analysis and automated verification, with a focus on applying these techniques to binaries. Some of the technical artifacts I have worked on include:

- Decoders and semantics for PowerPC and ARM
- Modeling of operating system behaviors
- Multi-architecture binary rewriting
- An implementation of the DTrace language for bare-metal machine code programs
- Verifiers for safety properties of legacy programs

I got my PhD in Computer Science (studying Programming Languages) at the University of Wisconsin--Madison in 2013 working with Ben Liblit.  My work used static analysis to improve promote language interoperability and enable safer reuse of legacy code.  In particular, I analyzed C libraries to automatically generate idiomatic library bindings for high-level programming languages, with a focus on generating *idiomatic* interfaces that took advantage of high-level language features.  My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science at North Carolina State University.
