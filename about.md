title: About

My name is Tristan Ravitch and I am a Computer Science PhD student at
the University of Wisconsin--Madison.  In practice, that means I just
have fun with computers.  I finished my undergraduate degree at North
Carolina State University in 2007.  Since then I have been working
with Ben Liblit.

My area of interest is nominally Programming Languages.  That said,
I don't really have much desire to make new languages.  Instead, I
focus on program analysis.  Specifically, I am interested in:

 * Language interoperability
 * Promoting high-level language use
 * Finding bugs
 * Tools and techniques to improve program understanding

For the record, here is a picture of me looking pretty cool at the Memorial
Union Terrace:
