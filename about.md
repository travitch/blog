title: About
---

My name is Tristan Ravitch and I am a software engineer in Portland,
Oregon.  I got my PhD in Computer Science (studying Programming
Languages) at the University of Wisconsin--Madison in 2013; my advisor
was Ben Liblit.  I worked on using static analysis to promote language
interoperability.  In particular, I analyzed C libraries to
automatically generate idiomatic library bindings for high-level
programming languages.  My undergraduate degree was in Computer
Science at North Carolina State University.

In my free time, I like to ride bicycles.  For the record, here is a
picture of me looking pretty cool at the University of Wisconsin
Memorial Union Terrace:
