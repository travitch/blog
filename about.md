title: About

My name is Tristan Ravitch. I am a Principal Researcher at [Galois](https://galois.com/) in Portland, Oregon. My research area is legacy systems understanding, assurance, and resilience. That work has involved static analysis and automated verification, with a focus on applying these techniques to binaries. Some of the technical artifacts I have worked on include:
* Decoders and semantics for PowerPC and ARM
* Modeling of operating system behaviors
* Multi-architecture binary rewriting
* An implementation of the DTrace language for bare-metal machine code programs
* Verifiers for safety properties of legacy programs


I got my PhD in Computer Science (studying Programming Languages) at the University of Wisconsin--Madison in 2013 working with Ben Liblit.  My work used static analysis to improve promote language interoperability and enable safer reuse of legacy code.  In particular, I analyzed C libraries to automatically generate idiomatic library bindings for high-level programming languages, with a focus on generating *idiomatic* interfaces that took advantage of high-level language features.  My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science at North Carolina State University.
