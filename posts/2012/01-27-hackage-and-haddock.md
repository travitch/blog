It looks like the
[documentation for my taffybar package](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/taffybar/0.2.0/doc/html/System-Taffybar.html)
is finally being built on Hackage.  I am confused because I certainly
didn't change anything relevant in my packaging.  It works, though, so
I'm not going to complain.
