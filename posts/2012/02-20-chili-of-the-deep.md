This weekend we had our annual chili party (coinciding with the Polar
Plunge).  In lieu of jumping into a frozen lake, I decided to just
make chili.  I'm recording the recipe here for posterity and so that I
don't have to try to guess at what I did next year.

## Chili of the Deep

 * Makes about 40 pounds
 * 2-3 hour prep time
 * 8 hour cook time

### Ingredients

 * 6 large onions
 * 4 pounds beans
 * 6 large cans of diced and/or crushed tomatoes
 * 3 cans of tomato paste
 * 4 pounds of stew beef
 * 4 pounds of bacon
 * 1 pound of jalapenos
 * 4 large bell peppers
 * Garlic, chili powder, cumin, and turmeric to taste


These numbers reflect the modifications that I should have made this
year.  A few slightly hotter peppers would also be good.

### Secret Ingredients of the Deep

 * 1 bag of cuttlefish
 * 1 liter of rum (Kraken rum for true depth)

### Preparation and Assembly

Dice the onions and peppers.  Cut the bacon into reasonable bite-sized
pieces.  Distribute the ingredients throughout the pot in layers to
help mix and then cook on low for about 8 hours.  Stir often.
