After 22 (or was it 23?) years of formal education, I am no longer a
student.  I defended my dissertation on August 9 and deposited it on
August 20.  I will post a copy of my dissertation online shortly.

It feels good to finally be done.

I start work at [Galois](http://corp.galois.com/) shortly.  Until
then, I am just learning how to get around Portland and hopefully
riding some bicycles.  I am also going to spend some time catching up
on some of my open source projects.  There are several outstanding
bugs that I ignored while I was finishing my dissertation.  I might
even make some releases of some software while I am at it.
